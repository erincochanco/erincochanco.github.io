	<div class="QnA">
		<a id="one"><div class="Q">1&nbsp;. What’re the advantages or disadvantages of being a working student?</div></a>

		<div class="A">Plain and simple, I am doing it for the money. But more seriously, I need a more consistent flow of income given that I am back in the city in an apartment rather than back home like last semester. I have to pay all my bills and rent somehow and having a job really alleviates the stress so I don't keep digging into my savings.</div>

		<br>
		
		<div class="Q">
		2.&nbsp;How does this affect your social life?
		</div>

		<div class="A">My social life really hasn't been affected because of my job. In all honesty, the amount of workload I get from my classes this semester is making it harder to go out. But even then, I am really close with my roommate and we make it work.</div>

		<br>

		<div class="Q">3.&nbsp;How do your parent/s or guardian/s feel about it?</div>
		<div class="A">Since my parents are helping pay for my share of the rent, they did expect me to get a job. Also, even without their pressure, I wanted to get a job to begin with.</div>
		
		<br>

		<div class="Q">4.&nbsp;How long have you been working?</div>
		<div class="A">I have been working since mid-August, around two weeks after I moved into the city. However, I have been working at a Starbucks since last October, I just transferred to one in the city.</div>
		
		<br>

		<a id="five"><div class="Q">5.&nbsp;Do you have any strategies for time management?</a>
		<div class="A">As I said before, my job isn't too much of a time constraint given that I only work three times a week for a total of around 15-16 hours a week. I actually worked during the school year back home last semester and I was even picking up more shifts than I am now. But to keep myself on track, I plan out my week of all the assignments I have to do for school so I can spresad the workload.</div>
		
		<br>

		<div class="Q">6.&nbsp;Have youlearned anything on the job that’s informed your art</div>
		<div class="A">I work at Starbucks so the correlation to my art is slim, however, I have learned how to work and communicate with a variety of people. In addition, I learned to be patient and understand people function at all different levels. Given that I work in a field that often thrives in collaborative work, strong interpersonal skills are essential.</div>
		
		<br>

		<div class="Q">
			7.&nbsp;How did COVID affect your work-life-school balance?
		</div>
		<div class="A">Plain and simple, I am doing it for the money. But more seriously, I need a more consistent flow of income given that I am back in the city in an apartment rather than back home like last semester. I have to pay all my bills and rent somehow and having a job really alleviates the stress so I don't keep digging into my savings.</div>
		
		<br>

		<div class="Q">8.&nbsp;What do you usually do with your earnings?</div>
		<div class="A">Funny enough, I actually made a spreadsheet and planned out how I am going to divide my earnings. On that list was my rent, my bills, groceries, monthly subscriptions like Spotify, money for eating out -- or at least the ones I can remember. Whatever is left is my "fun" money.</div>
		
		<br>

		<div class="Q">9.&nbsp;Would you say the relationship you have with your coworkers versus classmates feel different?</div>
		<div class="A">My relationship with my coworkers is not that much different than my one with my classmates. If you look at it, my job is just another class I go to. I see and work with these people three times a week, and with all that time shared, we get very comfortable with each other. I actually made a good fiend at the Starbucks back home who came to visit me a couple weeks ago, she and I have gotten really close during the time we worked together.</div>
		
		<br>

		<a id="ten"><div class="Q">10.&nbsp;Are there aspects of your identity (i.e. race/gender/religion) that’ve made your job more difficult?</div></a>
		<div class="A">Not as much when I worked at Starbucks, but I have gotten racist remarks before in previous jobs. When I worked at a local pet retail store, while I was still training I accidentally rang up someone incorrectly. I found out later on that the customer went to one of my coworkers and told them "You better watch out for that ethnic kid" I was just taken aback when I heard this information. But now, I have really experienced much adversity at work.</div>
