			The first iteration heavily references Starbucks, the interviwee's workplace, through color and illustrative content. 
			For the following interations, I tried to drive away from that as I felt it was a crutch I defaulted to in order to avoid assing interest through coding elements. Coding elements such as hover effects or animations.

	<div class="b"><a href="https://erincochanco.github.io/interview-2/">Interview 2<br></a></div>
		<div class="b-text">
			This version tries to stray away from heavily calling on Starbucks' color pallete. For this, I tried to utilize the hover function to add interst to the website. As for typographic choice, I chose to italicize the questions instead of emboldening it to add visual texture.

	<div class="c"><a href="https://erincochanco.github.io/interview-3/">Interview 3<br></a></div>
		<div class="c-text">
			The last version exhibits a clean, minimal page that banks on type to relay it's information. The navigation brings you to sections 1, 5, or 10 instead of every question number to avoid redundancy as the content is closely grouped.
