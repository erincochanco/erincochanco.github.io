		<br><div class="proj-or-exec">Project</div><br><div class="desc">For the first project of the term, we were tasked to create website that showcased an interview conducted between partners. I was partnered with Rand Rivera, who works as a part-time barista at Starbucks. My questions consequently focused on this aspect of his life.<br><br>

		The website reflected the central theme of the interview. For the color palette, green was primarily utilized as it referenced Starbucks' branding. I additionally illustrated icons that featured relevant visuals such as coffee cups, coffee beans and a barista apron.
