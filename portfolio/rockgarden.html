		<br><div class="proj-or-exec">Project</div><br><div class="desc">The Rock Garden project was to curate at least 20 items centering around a united theme. I initially proposed to create a website that compiled handwritten Taylor Swift related tweets. The project was entitled "Tweeter Swift". As a chronic procrastinator, I wasn't able to accomplish the project. The night before the deadline, I decided to cut my losses and restart with a new idea. Thus came about "20 Things I Did to Procrastinate". <br><br> Represented by illustrations and accompanying captions, the new concept showcases an inventory of activities I did to avoid doing my work.
		As time was an important element of my problem (procrastintion) the boxes the illustrations are housed in function as a unit of time. Hence, acitivites that took up more time take up more space.
