<!--   QUESTION 1 -->
<div class="block-green section-1">
 <div class="block-question">
    <div class="question-container">
    <div class="question">
      <b>What’re the advantages or disadvantages of being a working student?</b>
    </div>
  </br>
    <div class="answer">
      Plain and simple, I am doing it for the money. But more seriously, I need a more consistent flow of income given that I am back in the city in an apartment rather than back home like last semester. I have to pay all my bills and rent somehow and having a job really alleviates the stress so I don't keep digging into my savings.

<!--   QUESTION 2 -->
<div class="question-container">
    <div class="question">
      <b>How does this affect your social life?</b>
    </div> 
    </br>
    <div class="answer">
      My social life really hasn't been affected because of my job. In all honesty, the amount of workload I get from my classes this semester is making it harder to go out. But even then, I am really close with my roommate and we make it work.

 <div class="block-question">
    <div class="question-container">
    <div class="question">
      <b>How do your parent/s or guardian/s feel about it?</b>
    </div>
  </br>
    <div class="answer">
      Since my parents are helping pay for my share of the rent, they did expect me to get a job. Also, even without their pressure, I wanted to get a job to begin with.

<!--   QUESTION 4 -->
<div class="question-container">
    <div class="question">
      <b>How long have you been working?</b>
    </div> 
    </br>
    <div class="answer">
      I have been working since mid-August, around two weeks after I moved into the city. However, I have been working at a Starbucks since last October, I just transferred to one in the city.

 <div class="block-question">
    <div class="question-container">
    <div class="question">
      <b>Do you have any strategies for time management?</b>
    </div>
  </br>
    <div class="answer">
      As I said before, my job isn't too much of a time constraint given that I only work three times a week for a total of around 15-16 hours a week. I actually worked during the school year back home last semester and I was even picking up more shifts than I am now. But to keep myself on track, I plan out my week of all the assignments I have to do for school so I can spresad the workload.

<!--   QUESTION 6 -->
<div class="question-container">
    <div class="question">
      <b>How does this affect your social life?</b>
    </div> 
    </br>
    <div class="answer">
      I work at Starbucks so the correlation to my art is slim, however, I have learned how to work and communicate with a variety of people. In addition, I learned to be patient and understand people function at all different levels. Given that I work in a field that often thrives in collaborative work, strong interpersonal skills are essential.

      <b>How did COVID affect your work-life-school balance?</b>

    <div class="question">
      <b>What do you usually do with your earnings?</b>
    </div> 
    </br>
    <div class="answer">
      Funny enough, I actually made a spreadsheet and planned out how I am going to divide my earnings. On that list was my rent, my bills, groceries, monthly subscriptions like Spotify, money for eating out -- or at least the ones I can remember. Whatever is left is my "fun" money.

 <div class="block-question">
    <div class="question-container">
    <div class="question">
      <b>Would you say the relationship you have with your coworkers versus classmates feel different?</b>
    </div>
  </br>
    <div class="answer">
      My relationship with my coworkers is not that much different than my one with my classmates. If you look at it, my job is just another class I go to. I see and work with these people three times a week, and with all that time shared, we get very comfortable with each other. I actually made a good fiend at the Starbucks back home who came to visit me a couple weeks ago, she and I have gotten really close during the time we worked together.

<!--   QUESTION 10 -->
<div class="question-container">
    <div class="question">
      <b>Are there aspects of your identity (i.e. race/gender/religion) that’ve made your job more difficult?</b>
    </div> 
    </br>
    <div class="answer">
      Not as much when I worked at Starbucks, but I have gotten racist remarks before in previous jobs. When I worked at a local pet retail store, while I was still training I accidentally rang up someone incorrectly. I found out later on that the customer went to one of my coworkers and told them "You better watch out for that ethnic kid" I was just taken aback when I heard this information. But now, I have really experienced much adversity at work.
